# ConversationLearner

**ConversationLearner** is an enterprise Agentic AI assistant built on the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). It acts as an LLM-as-a-judge over conversational trajectories to detect friction and hallucination, generating metadata enrichment proposals.

## Architecture & Integration
- **Trajectory Analysis**: Uses Cloud Logging to fetch recent conversational trajectories. For each conversation, the messages from every inference log entry are merged (deduplicated, in chronological order) into one transcript — earlier entries backfill any later entry whose `gen_ai.*.messages` label exceeded Cloud Logging's 64 KiB limit and was truncated.
- **Per-conversation LLM-as-a-judge**: Each conversation is judged **independently and in parallel** (a direct Vertex `generate_content` call per conversation), extracting detection signals, gaps, and `ContextEnrichmentProposal` records. This bounds each judge's context for more consistent analysis and scales to many conversations, instead of analyzing every conversation in a single pass.
- **Cross-conversation dedup**: A lightweight aggregation pass deduplicates proposals across conversations (same asset + gap type), keeping the highest-confidence instance, before saving to `proposal.json`.

## Running Locally

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
export GOOGLE_GENAI_USE_VERTEXAI=True

# Authenticate so the Cloud Logging client can read trajectories
gcloud auth application-default login

# From the conversation_learner directory
adk run .
```

Example prompt:
```
generate learnings for projects/<project-number>/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/<engine-id> in the past 7 days
```

The agent will print the number of log entries retrieved, the unique conversation IDs found, and save enrichment proposals to `proposal.json`.

> **Note on Observability**: The agent retrieves conversations from Cloud Logging using OpenTelemetry trace logs (`gen_ai.client.inference.operation.details`). These logs are only emitted for sessions that ran while **Observability was enabled** on the Reasoning Engine. Sessions started before Observability was activated will not appear.

## Running Tests

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT=test-project

# From the agents/ directory
/path/to/venv/bin/python3 -m pytest conversation_learner/tests/ -v
```

## Deployment Instructions

The agent can be managed and deployed on Vertex AI Agent Engine (Reasoning Engines) using the `deploy.py` script. The script uses environment variables for configuration.

### Service Account & IAM Permissions

When deployed on Vertex AI Reasoning Engines, the runtime container executes under a designated service account. You can specify this account by exporting the `SERVICE_ACCOUNT` environment variable before deploying.

#### Required IAM Roles

To successfully fetch logs and execute agent logic, the target service account must be granted the following roles:
*   **Logging Viewer** (`roles/logging.viewer`): To read Cloud Logging entries for agent trajectories.
*   **Service Usage Consumer** (`roles/serviceusage.serviceUsageConsumer`): On the billing project.
*   **Storage Object Admin** (`roles/storage.objectAdmin`): On the Cloud Storage staging bucket.

### Observability & Telemetry

The runtime container is automatically instrumented with OpenTelemetry tracing and Cloud Logging correlation.

### Prerequisites

Create and activate a Python virtual environment, then install required dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 1. Creating a New Deployment

To deploy a new instance of ConversationLearner:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
export STAGING_BUCKET="gs://your-staging-bucket"  # Optional; defaults to gs://{project_id}-adk-staging
export DEPLOY_ACTION="create"

python3 deploy.py
```

### 2. Updating an Existing Deployment

To update an existing agent engine runtime (e.g. after updating instructions or authentication logic):

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
export DEPLOY_ACTION="update"
export RESOURCE_ID="projects/your-project-id/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/your-engine-id"

python3 deploy.py
```

### 3. Deleting a Deployment

To remove an agent engine resource:

```bash
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="your-project-id"
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_LOCATION="us-central1"
export DEPLOY_ACTION="delete"
export RESOURCE_ID="projects/your-project-id/locations/us-central1/reasoningEngines/your-engine-id"

python3 deploy.py
```
