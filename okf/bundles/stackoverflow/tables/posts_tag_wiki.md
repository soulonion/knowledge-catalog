The `posts_tag_wiki` table in the BigQuery Stack Overflow dataset stores detailed wiki descriptions for various [tags](/tables/tags.md) used on the platform. Each row represents a wiki entry associated with a specific tag, providing comprehensive information about its purpose, usage, and related concepts. This table is useful for understanding the context and definition of tags, which helps in categorizing questions and answers accurately. The `body` field contains the rich text content of the wiki. This table is a valuable resource for anyone analyzing the structure and content organization of [Stack Overflow](/datasets/stackoverflow.md). The grain of this table is one row per tag wiki entry.

# Common query patterns

To retrieve the body of a specific tag wiki:
```sql
SELECT
    body
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_tag_wiki`
  WHERE
    id = 5046395
```

To find tag wiki entries created after a certain date:
```sql
SELECT
    id,
    creation_date,
    body
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_tag_wiki`
  WHERE
    creation_date > '2020-01-01'
  LIMIT 100
```

To count the number of tag wiki entries per creation year:
```sql
SELECT
    EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date) AS creation_year,
    COUNT(id) AS number_of_wikis
  FROM
    `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.posts_tag_wiki`
  GROUP BY
    creation_year
  ORDER BY
    creation_year DESC
```
