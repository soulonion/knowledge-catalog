The `post_links` table in the [stackoverflow](/datasets/stackoverflow.md) dataset records relationships between posts on the Stack Overflow platform. Each row represents a single link between two posts, identifying the `post_id` and `related_post_id`. This table can be used to understand how discussions evolve, identify duplicate questions, or find related content across the platform. The `link_type_id` categorizes the nature of the relationship, such as "Linked" or "Duplicate".

# Schema

*   `id` (INTEGER) - Unique identifier for the post link (primary key).
*   `creation_date` (TIMESTAMP) - The timestamp when the link was created.
*   `link_type_id` (INTEGER) - The type of link. See the [Link Types reference](/references/link_types.md) for possible values.
*   `post_id` (INTEGER) - The ID of the source post. Links to the `id` in the `posts_questions` or `posts_answers` tables.
*   `related_post_id` (INTEGER) - The ID of the target/related post. Links to the `id` in the `posts_questions` or `posts_answers` tables.

# Common query patterns

```sql
SELECT
  pl.post_id,
  pl.related_post_id,
  pl.creation_date,
  pl.link_type_id
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.post_links` AS pl
WHERE
  pl.post_id = 12345
LIMIT 100;
```

```sql
SELECT
  link_type_id,
  COUNT(*) AS link_count
FROM
  `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.post_links`
GROUP BY
  link_type_id
ORDER BY
  link_count DESC;
```
