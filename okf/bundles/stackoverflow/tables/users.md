# Common query patterns

1.  Find the top 10 users by reputation:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      id,
      display_name,
      reputation
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
    ORDER BY
      reputation DESC
    LIMIT 10
    ```
2.  Count users created per year:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      EXTRACT(YEAR FROM creation_date) AS creation_year,
      COUNT(id) AS user_count
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
    GROUP BY
      creation_year
    ORDER BY
      creation_year
    ```
3.  Find users with a high number of upvotes given:
    ```sql
    SELECT
      display_name,
      up_votes
    FROM
      `bigquery-public-data.stackoverflow.users`
    WHERE
      up_votes > 1000
    ORDER BY
      up_votes DESC
    LIMIT 5
    ```
